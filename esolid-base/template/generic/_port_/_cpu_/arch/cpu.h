 * @brief       Interface of CPU port - Template
 * @addtogroup  template_cpu_intf
 * @brief       CPU port macros and functions
 * @details     Since this header file is included with the API of the kernel a
 *              few naming conventions are defined in order to avoid name
 *              clashing with the names of objects from libraries included by
 *              application code.
 *
 * @par         1) Macro naming conventions
 *              For macro naming try to follow these rules:
 *              - All standard PORT API macro names are prefixed with:
 *              @b @c PORT_.
 *              - All other macros which are specific to the port used are
 *              prefixed with: @b @c CPU_.
 *
 * @par         2) Type declaration naming conventions
 *              For type declaration naming try to follow these rules:
 *              - All type declaration names are prefixed with: @b @c port.
 *
 * @par         3) Global variable naming conventions
 *              For global variable naming try to follow these rules:
 *              - All global variable names are prefixed with: @b @c Port.
 *
 * @par         4) Function naming conventions
 *              For functions naming try to follow these rules:
 *              - All standard PORT API function names are prefixed with:
 *              <b><code>port</code></b>.
 *              - All other functions which are specific to the port used are
 *              prefixed with: <b><code>cpu</code></b>
 *              - All inline functions are additionally postfixed with: @b @c _
 *              (underscore).
 *              - The @c exception to above two rules are the names of functions
 *              used for Interrupt Service Routines. They can have any name
 *              required by the port.

 *

 *              bit map. In plain C this operation would be written as:

 *              this table can be used instead of the mentioned C code.
